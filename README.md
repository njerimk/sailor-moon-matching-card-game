*Please note that as of now development on this project has stopped, there were a lot of lessons learned and I am currently continuing practice of my skills on other projects. Thanks!

Sailor Cards Sailor Cards is a Phase 4 project that was created during my time in FlatIron’s Full Stack Web Developer Program. It was a project started out of interest in creating a simple game utilizing learned JavaScript at the time and my love for the classic anime Sailor Moon (American version 90s aesthetic) Sailor Cards operates as a web application/site that you can access to play a matching card game. It also utilizes a timer for the gameplay. Installation Git clone the repository Cd into backend and hit bundle install Now type in console, rails s to start the server it should open in a separate browser at localhost:3000 Now cd into the frontend and type npm I (npm install) Type in the console npm start to start the frontend server Once this is done it should open in another window once you select ‘Y’ (localhost:3001 for example) This application runs using Rails as its backend and postgresql for the backend database. The frontend uses the React Framework and Material UI for CSS
